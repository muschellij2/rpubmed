\title{Function to get coordinates from a supplied address

\usage{
geocode_address(address, depth = 3, sleeper = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{address}{string}

\item{depth}{depth integer recursion depth for attempting to get coordinates. If the full address fails to get a hit, the function is called again with the first line of the address removed. The process is repeated depth times before returning NAs}

\item{sleeper}{numeric Number of seconds to pause after doing the geocoding}
}
\value{
vector of address, lat, long
}
